<p>Smart Bin: The intelligent recycling bin. Powered by Particle.</p>

<h2>What is Smart Bin?</h2>
<p>
  Smart Bin is a Wi-Fi enabled recycling bin that records how many drink containers have been put into it.
  It uses the Core by Particle; a tiny, powerful development board that runs Arduino.
  Smart Bin accepts five different types of drink containers: glass bottles, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, plastic cups, and plastic milk cartons.
  The goal of Smart Bin is to collect data from students and faculty, getting statistics on what is the most popular type of drink.

</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  There are three parts of Smart Bin; the hardware, the firmware, and the software.  The hardware is the actual bin itself.
  Well sort of.  The bin has a special lid that includes the Particle Core and some circuitry.  Whenever a bottle, can or cup is put into its corresponding hole, the number of that type of drink is updated on the Core.
  The code running on the Core is called firmware.  This is the C++ code written for the Core, compiled and flashed, that runs while the Core has power.
<br><br>
  The software (website) is the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you are seeing right now.  The JavaScript calls the Particle API to variables from the Core, and displays it on the <a href="stats.html">stats page.</a>
  The HTML is what your browser sees, and the CSS is what makes it look pretty.
</p>

<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of Smart Bin to get people excited about recycling, whilst bringing attention to the environmental problems of the pacific garbage patch.
  People can see how many bottles have been collected, and track how many of each type of bottle.
</p>

<h2>Where is it?</h2>
<p>
  Smart Bin is located in the cafeteria of ACS Hillingdon International School, at 108 Vine Lane, Hillingdon, Middlesex, UB10 0BE, England.

<h2>Powered by Particle</h2>
<p>
Smart Bin was developed using the Core by <a href="https://particle.io/">Particle</a>.  Particle is one of my favourite startups, and I love using the Core for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a> projects.
Particle has made two other devices: the Photon and the Electron.  The Photon is the reincarnation of the Core; it is more powerful, faster, efficient and cheaper.
The Electron, their newest board uses 2G and 3G, and can be used anywhere in the world.

<h1>Why recycle?</h1>

<h2>Recycling conserves resources</h2>
<p>
When we recycle, used materials are converted into new products, reducing the need to consume natural resources. If used materials are not recycled, new products are made by extracting fresh, raw material from the Earth, through mining and forestry.
Recycling helps conserve important raw materials and protects natural habitats for the future.
<h2>Recycling saves energy</h2>
<p>
Using recycled materials in the manufacturing process uses considerably less energy than that required for producing new products from raw materials – even when comparing all associated costs, like transport.
Plus there are extra energy savings because more energy is required to extract, refine, transport and process raw materials ready for industry compared with providing industry-ready materials.
</p>
<h2>Recycling helps protect the environment</h2>
<p>
Recycling reduces the need for extracting (mining, quarrying and logging), refining and processing raw materials all of which create substantial air and water pollution.
As recycling saves energy it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. Current UK recycling is estimated to save more than 18 million tonnes of CO2 a year – the equivalent to taking 5 million cars off the road.
</p>
<h2>Recycling reduces landfill</h2>
<p>
When we recycle, recyclable materials are reprocessed into new products, and as a result the amount of rubbish sent to landfill sites reduces. There are over 1,500 landfill sites in the UK, and in 2001, these sites produced a quarter of the UK's emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
