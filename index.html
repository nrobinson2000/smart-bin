<p>Smart Bin: The intelligent recycling bin. Powered by Particle.</p>

<h2>What is Smart Bin?</h2>
<p>
  Smart Bin is a Wi-Fi enabled recycling bin that records how many drink containers have been put into it.
  It uses the Core by Particle; a tiny, powerful development board that runs Arduino.
  Smart Bin accepts 5 different types of drink containers: glass bottles, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, plastic cups, and plastic milk cartons.
  The goal of Smart Bin is to collect data from students and faculty, getting statistics on what is the most popular type of drink.

</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  There are three parts of Smart Bin; the hardware, the firmware, and the software.  The hardware is the actual bin itself.
  Well sort of.  The bin has a special lid that includes the Particle Core and some circutry.  Whenever a bottle, can or cup is put into its corresponding hole, the number of that type of drink is updated on the Core.
  The code running on the Core is called firmware.  This is the C++ code written for the Core, compiled and flashed, that runs while the Core has power.
<br>
  The software (website) is the HTML and JavaScript you are seeing right now.  The JavaScript calls the Particle API to variables from the Core, and displays it on the <a href="stats.html">stats page.</a>
